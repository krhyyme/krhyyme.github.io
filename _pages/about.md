I am a data scientist and software engineer working in the operations research domain. I've spent most of my career building
statistical and optimization tools for a variety of inventory management and network design problems.

I have a B.S. in Biochemistry from Pennsylvania State University and an M.S. in Data Science from the University of Rochester. In
the past - I worked in a systems biology lab helping build models of biological signaling systems. This work was part of an effort to create a boolean network model of cellular mechanisms related to plant drought tolerance found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003451).

I'm an avid reader in my free time. I enjoy reading about North African and Western Asian history, philosophy, and science fiction.
I'm either out for a run or playing strategy games if I'm not reading.
