# Reflections on being a data scientist

I was recently asked about my experiences working as a data scientist by a close friend looking to transition out of 
academia once he completed his PhD. Considering a data science role, he asked _"What are three things you wish you knew at the 
start of your career?"_

### The title Data Scientist can describe many different roles.

Data science is often used as a catch-all term by business leaders to describe  heavily quantitative work their team
or company does. I've seen Data Science used to describe the application of quantitative models to a diverse set of 
domains. A non-exhaustive list would include pricing, personalization, operations research, demand forecasting, 
and survey analysis work. In addition, this doesn't capture the range of machine learning / data science engineering roles
that focus on deploying and maintaining models in production.

Each domain can require a unique mix of technical and soft skill sets. This is why it's hard to take the what is a  "real data scientist"
articles seriously. There is a diversity of skill sets that match the diversity of application domains. And often, successful analysts/software engineers who
have worked in these domains since before the "data science revolution" don't fit the zeitgeist of the data science blogoshpere. 

My recommendation to my friend was to identify what domains excite you and fill any identified skill gaps. Then chase interesting work
wherever it leads regardless of job title or whether someone online thinks its "real data science."

### Good code is organized code

Software engineering is almost entirely about managing complexity. Especially, when it comes to managing machine learning
or statistical modeling pipelines. When I hear the term "good code" used in my professional life it often means the code
base is:

* Readable: someone reading the code can _easily_ identify the moving parts and how they interact.
* Parsimonious: Doesn't engage in unnecessary complexity. No feature is more complex than the problem it is trying to 
solve.
* Documented: There is ample documentation that discusses how to use the codebase, what the codebase does, and how it works.

As data scientist we are professional programmers. And we need to care deeply about the craftsmanship of the tools we 
build. 

### Figure out your personal brand

Getting a job isn't just about aligning skills and interests between potential employees and the role. Companies have interests
in maintaining specific team and broader organization wide cultures.
