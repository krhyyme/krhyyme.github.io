# Reflections on being a data scientist

I was recently asked about my experiences working as a data scientist by a close friend looking to transition out of 
academia once he completed his PhD. Considering a data science role, he asked _"What are five things you knew, or advice you wish you were given, at the 
start of your career?"_

### Lot's of things are "Data Science"

Data science is often used as a catch-all term by business leaders to describe  heavily quantitative work their team
or company does. I've seen Data Science used to describe the application of quantitative models to a diverse set of 
domains. A non-exhaustive list would include pricing, personalization, operations research, supply chain management, 
and survey analysis work.

The vast majority of domains have been around for decades before popularization of the term data science. The best thing you can do
when finding yourself working in a domain you are unfamiliar with is learn how to solve the "textbook problems" of the 
field do a literature review on topics specific to your role. 

### Good code is organized code

Software engineering is almost entirely about managing complexity. Especially, when it comes to managing machine learning
or statistical modeling pipelines. When I hear the term "good code" used in my professional life it often means the code
base is:

* Readable: someone reading the code can _easily_ identify the moving parts and how they interact.
* Parsimonious: Doesn't engage in unnecessary complexity. No feature is more complex than the problem it is trying to 
solve.
* Documented: There is ample documentation that discusses how to use the codebase, what the codebase does, and how it works.

As data scientist we are professional programmers. And we need to care deeply about the craftsmanship of the tools we 
build. Our models must solve the technical problem as well be efficient to use.
